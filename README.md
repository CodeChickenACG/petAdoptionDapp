# Full-Stacked Decentralized Web3 Application for Pet Adoption
## Issue addressed:
Many centralized pet adoption platforms still need a transparent and trustworthy environment. This project addresses the need for more transparency and security in traditional pet adoption processes. This platform facilitates secure and transparent pet adoptions using the microchip number of each pet to build a trustworthy environment with blockchain technology.
## Abstract
This project introduces a solution to the problem of lack of trust and transparency in the pet adoption process. By using blockchain technology, this process may be established in a more secure and trustworthy environment compared to traditional centralized systems. This project addresses the need for more reliable and transparent adoption practices. Also, benefits all stakeholders involved in this process, including pet adopters, pet relinquishers, animals, and shelters. This approach makes use of pet microchip numbers(a broadly used RFID chip that most pets have), which can significantly reduce the risk of fraud and misinformation. It represents an essential step forward in the pet adoption process, offering a modern solution to a traditional problem.
